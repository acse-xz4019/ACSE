# Mesh Mapping System

## Introduction
This project implements a system for mapping mesh data, specifically focusing on transferring properties like temperature and pressure between meshes with potentially different structures. It uses advanced spatial data structures and interpolation methods to efficiently and accurately perform these mappings.

## Features
- Spatial partitioning with Octrees for efficient nearest neighbor searches.
- Gaussian Radial Basis Function (RBF) interpolation for accurate value mapping.
- Support for reading and processing mesh data from CSV files using a custom DataFrame structure.
- Visualization of mesh mappings using SFML.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- C++17 compiler
- Eigen Library for linear algebra operations
- SFML for visualization

### Installation library
Clone the repository and ensure you have the required dependencies installed.

```bash
brew install SFML
brew install Eigen
```
