# Solar System Simulation

## Project Introduction

This project uses C++ and the SFML graphics library to create a dynamic simulation of the solar system. It aims to showcase the orbiting motion of different planets around the sun based on Kepler's laws of motion. Through this project, users can explore the basic structure of the solar system and observe the dynamic positions of planets relative to the sun.

## Features

- **Accurate Simulation**: Calculates planet orbits using Kepler's laws, ensuring precise simulation of planetary motion.
Graphical Interface: Provides a graphical user interface created with the SFML library for an intuitive display of planetary motion.
- **Interactive Exploration**: Users can explore the solar system through simple interface interactions, choosing different display mode.
- **Educational Purpose**: Designed with educational objectives in mind to help learners understand basic concepts of astrophysics.

## Installation Guide

This project depends on the SFML graphics library. Ensure that your system has SFML installed. For installation instructions, refer to the [SFML official documentation](https://www.sfml-dev.org/documentation/2.6.1/).

## Usage

Run the compiled program. The initial view will present an overview of the solar system. Use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out, and click on planets to get more information.

## Tech Stack/Dependencies

- C++ (C++17 or later)
- SFML (2.5.1 or later)
